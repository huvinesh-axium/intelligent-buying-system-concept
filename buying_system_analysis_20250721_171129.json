The 2.5-day average delay on a 25-day lead time is modest, yet with such low volume there is limited evidence of how the supplier will perform under surge demand or disruption.

The supplier is a Tier-3 entity in South Korea, so geopolitical or logistics disruptions could compound its already high performance risk. Do not place further orders until a root-cause review confirms corrective actions; if critical, limit exposure to non-urgent, low-volume requirements under tight expedite clauses.",
      "concern_SUP-05": "Key strengths: Perfect on-time delivery (100 %) and Tier-1 status signal high reliability, but the 8-day average delay on a single order limits confidence and may understate true variability.  \nRisk factors: Very small data set (only one order) with no expedited/shift history makes quality and capacity predictability uncertain, and India\u2019s broader logistics disruptions (seasonal port congestion, monsoon) could amplify delays.  \nRecommendations: Place 2-3 additional pilot orders under 30-day lead times and impose penalty clauses >8 days; negotiate buffer stock on critical SKUs to keep safety stock ~10 days above usage until a larger, consistent sample (+6 orders) validates lead-time claims."
