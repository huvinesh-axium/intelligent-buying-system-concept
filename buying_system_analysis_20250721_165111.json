Strengths: Shenzhen Electronics has perfect on-time delivery and a high reliability score (93.25/100), but the 4.5-day average delay on a 30-day lead time suggests shipments are consistently arriving just inside the contractual window rather than early.  \n2. Risk factors: With only two historical orders, the sample size is too small to confirm that 100 % on-time performance is sustainable; any demand spike or disruption could quickly expose hidden variability.  \n3. Recommendations: Place a few moderate-sized, non-critical orders over the next quarter to enlarge the data set and test consistency; negotiate a 27-day committed lead time to absorb the observed 4.5-day lag and build a small safety stock until performance is proven at scale.",
      "concern_SUP-06": "Key Strengths & Weaknesses  \nDespite having only one sample order, the supplier delivered early (-1 day delay), yet its 0 % on-time rate and 30/100 reliability score signal inconsistent or possibly mis-recorded performance data; the substitution and 100 % expedited rate suggest limited inventory or process control.\n\nRisk Factors  \nSingle-order sample size, Tier 3 status, and low reliability make future disruptions highly probable; quality may vary because of the substitution incident.\n\nRecommendations  \nRun a pilot of 2\u20133 small, non-critical orders under close monitoring before committing volume; require firm pre-shipment quality checks and a short (\u226410-day) lead-time buffer to verify consistency.",
      "concern_SUP-07": "NextGen Components shows no on-time deliveries and a 100 % substitution rate on its single order, indicating severe reliability issues; the negative average delay (-1 day) is meaningless given the tiny sample. The sole expedited order suggests the supplier itself triggered the delay, posing high schedule risk for any critical-path items. Until they demonstrate consistent performance on at least 5\u201310 non-expedited orders, limit them to non-critical, low-volume purchases and require advance buffer stock or dual sourcing.",
